## GSVD 

This package is used to solve multiole sparse group sparse matrix factorization optimization problems in our paper <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>. 

More descriptions about these functions can be found in their annotation part.

Note that before running the codes, please first set the path for "Fun1_OR.R", "Fun1_OGR.R" and "Fun3_get_Fig2A.R".

Please run the following R command in the Console. 
>> source('Fun3_get_Fig2A.R')
